# CoderbyteReceiptTask

I`ve created the project with the structure of a gem. 

## Usage

Run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. 
Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. 

To run as a script, you can enter the purchased items as args, ex:

ruby lib/coderbyte/receipt.rb "3 books at 11.49" "2 music CD at 4.99" "1 chocolate box at 4.85"
